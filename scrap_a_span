#Baby steps to learn BeautifulSoup4
#Python for Everyone on how to scrape span elements and then get the sum of the numbers in the spans.
#First thing that needs to be done is to import the needed items
import urllib.request, urllib.parse, urllib.error
from bs4 import  BeautifulSoup
#I believe that it is good practice to check for SSL issues using the SSL import
import ssl

ctx = ssl.create_default_context()
ctx.check_hostname = False
ctx.verify_mode = ssl.CERT_NONE
#We first need to get the address from the user
url = input('Enter - ')
#Using the urllib.request we open the page.
html = urllib.request.urlopen(url, context=ctx).read()
#Thankfully, we have BeautifulSoup to do the paring for us.
soup = BeautifulSoup(html, 'html.parser')

#The tag I am looking for here is a span element.
tags = soup('span')
#Creat an empty list.
the_spans = []
#Loop through the items to look for the tag I want.
for tag in tags:
  #I want the contents of the tag at the first (0th) index.
  results = (tag.contents[0])
#Convert the list from a string to an int.
  int_results = int(results)
#Append the items to the list
  the_spans.append(int_results)
 #Some the total of the numbers in the span elements and then print them.
print(sum(the_spans))
