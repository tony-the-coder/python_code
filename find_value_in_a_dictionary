# How to find how often a character appears in a string
# First create a dictionary
letter_dict=dict()
text = "aaabccc"
# Use a for loop to add the keys to the dictionary
for letter in text:
  #If the key does not exist add the key and set the value to 0, if the key and value pair exist add one to the value. 
  letter_dict[letter] = letter_dict.get(letter, 0) +1
#To find the occurances, loop through the dictionary again. 
for key, value in letter_dict.items():
#If the value is one that means that there are no duplicates in the initial string. 
  if value == 1:
    print(key, '=', value)
    #Here we print the key that has a value of one.
    print("The letter", key, "only appears once." )
if value !=1 :
  print("_")
